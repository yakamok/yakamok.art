Goal is to keep this site simple and as litle code as possible.  

upload.py: this simple program is used to process all images and upload the changes to the production server

### Todo:  

1. Change flex from columns to rows this will change the amount of php needed.  
2. change how the photos are ordered - by date  
3. fix css menus to work better on mobile(not priority)  
4. add footer contact info - twitter,email,instagram  
5. is it worth creating a backend to manage the site???  
6. clean up code!!!
